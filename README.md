## üîç About Me  
I love optimizing workflows and solving complex design challenges. In my fourth year at Tsinghua University, I joined Professor Huang Weixin's research group, where I worked on digital fabrication and automation, enhancing the efficiency of customized structures. My role spanned design optimization, digital fabrication, and workflow automation, focusing on streamlining complex processes. <a href="https://hychia88.github.io/"> Project ‚Üó </a>  
  
Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Computational Design at Carnegie Mellon University, exploring the intersection of software engineering, AI, and automation to integrate cutting-edge technology into design. <a href="https://hychia88.github.io/cs-projects.html">Courses taken ‚Üó</a>
Beyond that, I worked as Architectural Robotics Research Assistant under Professor Joshua Bard at CMU, contributed research in 3D printing, and worked as an Architectural Intern at MAD Architects, specializing in generative modeling. More of my work can be found in my portfolio below.
